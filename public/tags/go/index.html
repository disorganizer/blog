    A bit more than a week since the last post, I&rsquo;m getting worse again. Screw it. Besides a lot of personal life stuff a major &ldquo;problem&rdquo; was solved: Writing to files. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like an impressive problem, I know. But how is brig able to modify existing files by writing somewhere in them, extending them or truncating them to some size? With the cli interface it&rsquo;s not much of a problem, a simple brig add updates the file: $ echo -n &#39;What now?&#39; &gt; file.txt $ brig add file.txt &amp;&amp; brig cat file.txt What now?  <a href="https://disorganizer.github.io/blog/post/the_write_layer/">Read More...</a>

    Another productive day, another update late in the night. A basic FUSE layer is integrated and is already able to display the contents of a util.trie.Trie as files and directories. Reading and writing is not yet implemented, since that&rsquo;s the part where fuse and brig actually need to&hellip; fuse. Here&rsquo;s a small session inside the fuse layer: λ ~ → brig mount /tmp/mount &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/mount λ /tmp/mount → touch hello # Creating file work.  <a href="https://disorganizer.github.io/blog/post/fuse_it_together/">Read More...</a>

    A bit more than one day after the last post. Not too bad. Basically, three smaller things happened since the last time. First, we now store files serialized as protobufs in the index persistently. The index is just a BoltDB database file (which I can recommend, it&rsquo;s nice). Secondly, the AES-key for each file is generated from the sha512 hash of the first 8KB of a file. We don&rsquo;t hash the full file for performance reasons, but there is nothing stopping us from hashing the whole file, so we fully apply to Wikipedia&rsquo;s definiton of convergent encryption.  <a href="https://disorganizer.github.io/blog/post/bolt_and_fingerprint/">Read More...</a>

    A small historic moment was achieved today: The very first file was added to brig. There was no way to get it out again, but hey - Progress comes in steps. Luckily, just two hours later there was a brig get command that could retrieve the file again from ipfs. This is also my very first devlog entry, so&hellip; Hi. I mainly write this to remember what I did (and when) on the course of the project.  <a href="https://disorganizer.github.io/blog/post/first_steps/">Read More...</a>
