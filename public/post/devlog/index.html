  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A small historic moment was achieved today: The very first file was added to
<code>brig</code>. There was no way to get it out again, but hey - Progress comes in
steps. Luckily, just two hours later there was a <code>brig get</code> command that
could retrieve the file again from <code>ipfs</code>.</p>

<p>This is also my very first devlog entry, so&hellip; Hi. I mainly write this to
remember what I did (and when) on the course of the project. Also it sometimes
is really useful to reflect on what kind of boolshit I wrote today. Ever
noticed that you get the best ideas doing arbitrary things like peeing? That&rsquo;s
the same effect, I guess. If it&rsquo;s fun to read for others&hellip; that&rsquo;s okay too.
I try to keep it updated after every more or less productive session.
That might mean daily, that might also mean once a week.</p>

<p>So, back to the technical side of life. <code>brig add</code> currently works a bit
confusing. It is supposed to read a regular file on the disk, compress and
encrypt it and add it to <code>ipfs</code>. The encryption and compression layer uses
<code>io.Writer</code> though, so we can&rsquo;t just stack <code>io.Reader</code> on top of each
other. Instead we need to use a nice little feature from the stdlib:
<code>io.Pipe()</code>. This function returns a <code>io.Writer</code> and a <code>io.Reader</code>. Every
write on the writer produces a corresponding read on the reader - without internal
copying of the data. Yay. If you have a piece of API that needs a <code>io.Reader</code>,
but you just have a <code>io.Writer</code>, then <code>io.Pipe()</code> should pop into your mind now.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks in practice:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func NewFileReader(key []byte, r io.Reader) (io.Reader, error) {
	pr, pw := io.Pipe()

	// Setup the writer part:
	wEnc, err := encrypt.NewWriter(pw, key)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	wZip := compress.NewWriter(wEnc)

	// Suck the reader empty and move it to `wZip`.
	// Every write to wZip will be available as read in `pr`.
	go func() {
		defer func() {
			wEnc.Close()
			pw.Close()
		}()

		if _, err := io.Copy(wZip, r); err != nil {
			// TODO: Warn or pass to outside?
			log.Warningf(&quot;add: copy: %v&quot;, err)
		}
	}()

	return pr, nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for today! For tomorrow a cleanup session is planned and the piece
of code that derives the AES-Key from an unencrypted file.</p>
