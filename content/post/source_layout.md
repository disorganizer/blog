Hi there. Today's blog post is a unsorted notepad of how ``brig``'s source is
currently layout and what the big picture behind is supposed to look like.

Now that ``brig`` is already a mid-sized codebase (when did we get to 7k lines
of code?), it might be worthwhile to show what packages we have and how they
interact. Here's the ``tree(1)`` output of the git repository at the time of
writing. I allowed myself to reduce it to the most relevant files, also skipping
tests and rather unimportant subdirectories:

$ tree | grep -v 'unimportant' .

You might already have an idea how ``brig`` is working by now. There's a
command-line utility that speaks to a daemon that was somehow started, which
uses a store to ``add`` and ``cat`` files. The daemon is also capable of mounting 
a fuse filesystem, but before that it needs a repository to run in.
That's the very rough picture, but to recap this we have this diagram to show 
how the most important packages play together:

From a slightly wider view, the communication between two repositories
is supposed too look like this:

<img src="/img/brig_arch.svg" alt="Security architecture" width="800px"/>

I don't have any details to show here, simply because there is nothing to show
yet: The inter-repository communication simply does not exist yet. ðŸ˜‰

What's working now is mostly the fuse part (well, mostly, it already works like
a buggy and slow ``encfs``) and the versioning. Naturally the next goal is
to exchange some information between two ``brig`` nodes.
The cool thing about the current architecture is naturally that we don't need to
do any file exchange or storage ourselves, since ``ipfs`` handles that for us.
As long as we manage to get the hashes and keys across XMPP, we successfully 
share files - ``ipfs`` will make sure to load it from the swarm.

It's late here, so that's it for today.
